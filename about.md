Hi, Iâ€™m Drew Cain. I write software for software companies.

![The Real Drew Cain](/public/me.jpg)

I've been in the technology industry since 1998 and have been programming since 2002. I have an entrepreneurial spirit and have worked for numerous startup companies as well as government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. I enjoy fast paced working environments with high expectations and pride myself on building teams that deliver successful IT projects on time and under budget.

I specialize in Enterprise Software Architecture & Development, especially web based application development. This blog is focused on the things I've learned in my day-to-day experience. Enjoy!
